## Success Criteria

You'll know resumption is successful when Claude:
1. ✅ References your specific decisions (Flutter, Firebase, minimal dark)
2. ✅ Knows where you left off (ready to deploy)
3. ✅ Remembers user context (Windows, prefers step-by-step)
4. ✅ Continues without re-explaining basics

---

## Tips for Best Results

**Do:**
- ✅ Reference this file: "Continue from RESUME.md"
- ✅ Be specific: "Help with step 3 of GitHub deployment"
- ✅ Mention user context: "I'm on Windows, prefer GUI"

**Don't:**
- ❌ Say "start over" (use "continue" instead)
- ❌ Omit project name (always mention "DRMSI")
- ❌ Skip context file (Claude needs project-state.md)

```bash
claude ask "Please read these files in order:
1. project-state.md (full context)
